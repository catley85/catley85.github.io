            I'm a full stack developer. I love Ruby, sci-fi books, boardgaming,
            Vue.js, cycling, and Blink-182.
            <br>
            I'm currently a developer
            <a href="https://www.lexoo.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and work alongside a
            bunch of really cool and intelligent people.
            <br>
            Oh...I may also have an addiction to sourdough pizza.

            <h3>Recent work</h3>
            <h4><u>Graphere digital consultancy</u></h4>
            <h5 class="pb-3 pb-lg-1">
              As a fully remote developer for Graphere, one of the clients I worked with was
              Oxford University Press. Alongside their online dictionary team I was part of the
              engineering team that built their custom Rails based CMS platform, giving their staff
              the ability to update and maintain an online database with ease.
            </h5>
            <h4><u>Lexoo</u></h4>
            <h5 class="pb-3 pb-lg-1">
              Joining Lexoo as their second full stack developer, I've been a key part of
              their engineering team as it has grown from only myself and the CTO, to a six
              person department.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="pb-3 pb-lg-1">
              I was the lead developer on automating the company's accounting and client
              payment processes, integrating the codebase with third party Revolut and Xero software.
              Over its first six months the feature handled over £100,000 of client transactions and
              saved the accounting team more than 100 hours of time on performing manual operations.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="pb-3 pb-lg-1">
              As part of a company wide initiative to re-brand Lexoo, I assisted with the re-design of the
              company homepage through two versions and lead both re-builds, ensuring they were fully
              responsive and compatible in all modern browsers.
              <a href="https://www.lexoo.com/" target="_blank">View site.</a>
            </h5>
            <h5>
              Additionally I built and updated custom site components as part of an internal
              design system hosted as an NPM package. I used this to facilitate a complete
              re-design and build of Lexoo's client facing dashboard.
