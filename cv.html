            <p>
              After a seven year career in the cycling industry I decided to
              make a considerable change to my life and career in early 2017. I
              chose to use General Assembly’s web development immersive course
              as a stepping stone into the world of tech and programming, and
              since then have loved the challenges and learning opportunities
              provided in my professional roles as a developer. I’m open to
              exciting opportunities that will enable me to continue learning
              and growing my career within a challenging team environment.

            <h6 class="pt-5">Lexoo: April 2018 - September 2020</h6>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Joining Lexoo as their second full stack developer, I was a key
              part of their engineering team as it grew from only myself and the
              CTO, to a six person department.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              I was the lead developer on automating the company's accounting
              and client payment software. This involved integrating Revolut and
              Xero business accounts with Lexoo's proprietary products. Over its
              first six months the feature handled over £100,000 of client
              transactions and saved the accounting team more than 100 hours of
              time performing manual operations.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              After assisting in the design of the company homepage versions 2.0
              and 3.0, I also led the re-build for both versions, ensuring the
              site was fully responsive and compatible in all modern browsers.
              This was a key part of a company wide initiative to rebrand Lexoo.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Additionally I built and updated custom Vue.js components as part
              of an internal design system hosted as an NPM package. I used this
              to facilitate a complete redesign and build of Lexoo's client
              facing dashboard.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Other aspects of my role also included regularly resolving
              technical issues, bug fixes, and implementing new product features
              and updates.

            </h6>
            <p class="mb-3">
              As a developer at Graphere I developed an online editor for Oxford
              University Press. Predominantly a Rails based CMS platform using
              aspects of Vue.js code, the Delta Editor gave staff the ability to
              update and maintain an online database with ease.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Working in a small, fully remote team, we took part in two week
              sprints with bi-weekly stand-ups; this involved regular
              communication with other developers, product managers, and working
              alongside various members of the client team.

            <h6 class="pt-5">General Assembly: June 2017 - Sept 2017</h6>
            <p class="mb-3">
              The twelve week web development course allowed me to enhance my
              problem solving skills whilst enabling me to plan and build full
              stack web applications that adhered to various industry standards.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Over my period at GA each day began with a group stand up,
              providing a space to share challenges, solutions, and to review
              current progress. Following this the day was compiled of
              interactive lessons and paired programming labs designed to help
              with fast-paced learning in an agile environment. Collaborating
              with fellow cohorts and teaching others was a huge part of day to
              day activities and something that I found hugely beneficial and
              very much enjoyed.

            <h5 class="pt-3 pt-lg-4">INTERESTS</h5>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Outside of programming I’m a big fan of cycling, boardgaming,
              sci-fi and fantasy, zombies, and pizza.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Any kind of movie, book, or tv-show that involves a dystopian,
              fantasy themed, or zombie filled future is usually on my to watch
              or read list. I absolutely loved the original comic book series of
              The Walking Dead, the Fables graphic novels are brilliant, and
              Ready Player One by Ernest Cline and Only Forward by Michael
              Marshall Smith are two of my favourite reads.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              I’ve also watched and love all of the Marvel cinematic universe
              movies, and when it comes to pizza I’m a sucker for a sourdough
              spicy ‘Nduja.
